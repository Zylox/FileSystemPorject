Included both the vbs and the file systems folders
I dont think i changed anything in the vbs but its just for safety.

I did not finish on time, but a lot of stuff is working. I think.
Mount, Create, and destroy files should all be working.
I ran out of time working on write, and read or seek was not finished;

There are two unused variable warnings from -Wall but it was just because i didnt get to use them yet.

The thing that caught me up was a stupid serialization mistake. I was serializing the pointers.
It took me till the last day to realize it and then i had to retrofit everything after days of banging my head into the wall.
